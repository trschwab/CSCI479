AITA is an automated tacking system built for Elizabeth Capaldi 
- Bucknell University Animal Behavior Lab 2018

To run the system start the executable "AITA.exe"
The GUI has 3 options: 
one for running a 2d experiment
one for visualizing past experiments (2d/3d)
one for running a 3d experiment

In order to run the system you will need the following python libraries installed (pip install them if you do not have them)
We have dependencies located in the folder but essential keep installing packages until the executable runs without those crashes
 - OpenCV v2
 - Numpy
 - PyQt5

Make sure to have the USB cameras slotted into WORKING usb slots! If the camera is not detecting unplug it and retry


We hope you are able to find great things to do with our work!
 - AITA Team
